## Problem Statement 🎯

Real estate pricing in Tunisia varies dramatically by location. A 100 m2 apartment in Tunis costs fundamentally differently than the same property in Sfax or Kebili. This system addresses the challenge of predicting property prices across 264 delegations, where many regions lack sufficient training data, by combining direct modeling with hierarchical fallback benchmarks.

---

## Architecture Overview 🏗️

The system consists of three interconnected layers:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|------------|
| **Data Pipeline** | Eight-stage transformation from raw listings to trained model |
| **Prediction API** | FastAPI serving real-time predictions and model diagnostics |
| **Geographic Atlas** | Interactive frontend displaying coverage, predictions, and fallback tiers |

All components share common data artifacts, ensuring consistency between training and serving.

## Pipeline Stages 🔄

The pipeline transforms raw property listings through eight sequential stages:

### Stage 1: Dataset Discovery 🔍

Location: `pipeline/01_dataset_discovery.py`

> Loads and profiles raw data sources. Identifies column mappings for price, surface, location, and property type across three source datasets. Produces discovery profiles documenting data quality, value distributions, and schema assessments.

### Stage 2: Dataset Cleaning 🧹

Location: `pipeline/02_dataset_cleaning.py`

> Applies standardization rules across datasets. Handles encoding issues, trims whitespace, normalizes text fields, and filters obvious bad data. Removes duplicates based on key attribute combinations. Produces cleaned datasets ready for merging.

### Stage 3: Merge Preparation 🔗

Location: `pipeline/03_merge_preparation.py`

> Unifies multiple source datasets into a single training corpus. Resolves schema differences between sources, maps property types to consistent categories, and prepares join keys for geographic alignment. Produces a merged dataset with unified schema.

### Stage 4: Geographic Name Alignment 🗺️

Location: `pipeline/04_geo_name_alignment.py`

> Maps textual location names to official Tunisia geography. Uses fuzzy matching against delegation and governorate names, with alias mappings for common variations (e.g., "Ariana Ville" -> "Ariana", "La Soukra" -> "La Soukra"). Produces geo-aligned dataset with standardized delegation keys.

### Stage 5: Training Dataset Preparation 📋

Location: `pipeline/05_training_dataset_preparation.py`

> Prepares the final training dataset. Creates binary property family indicators (apartment, house, land), filters invalid rows, and structures data for modeling. Produces training-ready CSV with all required columns.

### Stage 6: Feature Engineering ⚙️

Location: `pipeline/06_feature_engineering.py`

> Transforms raw features into model-ready representations. Creates log-transformed price and surface, generates target-encoded geographic features (delegation and governorate mean prices), computes price-vs-local-median ratios, and prepares final feature matrices.

### Stage 7: Visual Check 👁️

Location: `pipeline/07_training_dataset_visual_check.py`

> Performs quality assurance on the training dataset. Samples records across regions, validates geographic distributions, and generates diagnostic visualizations. Ensures data quality before model training.

### Stage 8: Model Training 🧠

Location: `pipeline/08_model_training.py`

> Trains and evaluates prediction models. Compares GradientBoosting and RandomForest regressors, performs cross-validation, selects the best model, and generates performance reports. Exports the trained model artifact and frontend-ready coverage data.

## Fallback System 🔄

The geographic fallback system ensures predictions for all 264 delegations, even those without direct training data:

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Exact Delegation** | Sufficient data in the delegation (direct support) |
| **Locality Fallback** | Data from broader locality |
| **Delegation Fallback** | Delegation-level aggregated data |
| **Governorate Fallback** | Governorate-wide aggregated data |
| **National Fallback** | Country-wide average |

Each delegation receives a coverage level and benchmark prediction based on the best available data in its hierarchy. This approach guarantees 100% national coverage while distinguishing areas with direct evidence from those using borrowed benchmarks.

## Key Design Decisions 💡

### Why Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting outperformed RandomForest in cross-validation (0.928 vs 0.859 R2) while maintaining reasonable inference speed. The algorithm handles the mixed numeric/categorical feature space effectively.

### Why Target Encoding

Target encoding (mean price per delegation/governorate) provides compact geographic signal without one-hot encoding explosion. Combined with coordinate features, it enables smooth location-based predictions while maintaining interpretability.

### Why Hierarchical Fallbacks

Some delegations have zero listings. Rather than refusing predictions, the fallback system borrows evidence from broader regions, guaranteeing predictions everywhere while transparently documenting data quality.

### Why Log Transform

Real estate prices follow approximately log-normal distributions. Log-transforming price during training makes the target more Gaussian, improving model stability and performance.
